#+title: Hemeroteca

An awfull (but fast) program to find and open PDF papers from the terminal.

I was looking for a fast way to find papers inside a messy "Papers" directory in my computer. Also I was learning C, so trying to write this seems fun.

I used this program for about a year, but then I switched to dmenu because it's faster and looks better. 

I don't use this anymore, but was useful for a good amount of time. And was a lot of fun!
