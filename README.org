#+title: Hemeroteca

An awful (but fast) program to find and open PDF papers from the terminal.

I wanted a quick way to locate papers in a chaotic 'Papers' directory on my computer. Since I was also learning C, writing this seemed like a fun challenge.

I used this program for about a year before switching to dmenu, which is awesome if you use I3.

The design is really bad, and I know the code might have plenty of issues, but it was a fun and practical solution for a while.


** Installation

Before installation, modify config.h to specify the target directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/fdecunta/hemeroteca.git
cd hemeroteca
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

To remove the program:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd hemeroteca
sudo make uninstall
#+END_SRC

** How to use?


#+BEGIN_SRC shell
hemeroteca [-d DIR] [-s KEYWORD]
 -d DIR	        Abre hemeroteca en [DIR]
 -s KEYWORD	Busca archivos con KEYWORD en el nombre
#+END_SRC


Move using arrows or Vim keys. Press enter to open a file MuPDF, Ctrl+o to open with Okular
